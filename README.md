# Hair-Factory
A set of Geometry Nodes for complex hair styles and a gui to simplify the process of hair asset creation in Blender.

This project is in an Alpha stage. While the GUI is mostly functional, some of the Geometry Nodes are missing components due to transfering assets during appending from other files.
Documentation is delayed due to the GUI needing to be redesigned to a more user-friendly style. At the moment, it is recommended to append, from the HairFactory.blend file, but the current GUI if free to explore.
